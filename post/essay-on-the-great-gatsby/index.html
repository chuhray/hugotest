Gatsby was mistaken as the one who ran over Myrtle, when it was Daisy. He was also mistaken as Myrtle’s lover, when the actual lover was Tom, Daisy’s husband. George Wilson, seeking revenge, carried a gun to Jay’s house and out of spite and complete anger; the depressed widowed husband shoots the wrong and completely innocent man.<br />
Nick, alone, arranged Gatsby’s funeral. There, he meets Gatsby’s father and his experience of this affects the way he tells the story. Gatsby was friends with a great deal of people, however, when he was killed, no one</p>

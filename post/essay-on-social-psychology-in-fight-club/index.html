                <p>Deinviduation and Attraction in Fight Club Fight Club is a complex movie in that the two main characters are just two sides of the same person. Edward Norton’s character is the prototypical conformist consumer working a morally questionable office job to feed his obsession with material possessions.

In essence people lose their inhibitions and as a group act impulsively, which by human nature often leads to violence.<br />
The attraction theory of similarity is described in the book as simply that “people tend to like other people who are similar to themselves” (Social Psychology, 98). There are five main reasons that similarity</p>

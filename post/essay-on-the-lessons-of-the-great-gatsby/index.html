                <p>“The Great Gatsby” is a novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in the 1920’s. The novel is narrated by a young man named Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, New York to learn more about the bond business so he can eventually sell bonds. He moves into an average house in between two huge mansions, so in comparison his average house looks like a small, run down shack. One of the owners of those mansions, and Carraway’s new neighbor, is Jay Gatsby. Gatsby has huge extravagant parties every night and one day invites Carraway personally, which he never does. Gatsby is never seen at his own parties and no one really knows who he is though there are many rumors about whether he even exists or not and about what type of person he is. But he makes Scott Fitzgerald grew up in a poor family and didn’t want to end up like his parents who he saw as failures. He was taught to act like a gentleman and eventually got accepted into an Ivy League school. When he got there he was blinded by visions of every one loving him and wanted to be well known and loved by them all. The duration of his college days was spent partying and writing plays. After college he decided to join the war. One night he attended a dance for soldiers and met a girl there. He was certain he fell in love with her on the spot and was crazy over her to the point where he was almost obsessed. This girl was wealthy unlike he was, and eventually her father made them break up because in his mind “rich girls don’t marry poor boys”. Fitzgerald was completely distraught over the break up and missed her dearly. He kept all her letters to him and made them into a little makeshift book. He was later deported to Alabama to begin training, and just as his regiment was to be shipped out, the war ended. He was never able to fight and that upset him, but he still imagined himself a war hero nonetheless. He met a girl in Alabama named Zelda and fell in love with her and married her. They had one child</p>

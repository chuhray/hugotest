                <p>Elements of Psychology and Sociology in The Lord of the Flies</p>

He chooses to set the children alone in an unsupervised world, leaving them to learn ‘ the ways of the world’ in a natural setting first hand. Many different perspectives can also be considered. Golding&rsquo;s island of marooned youngsters becomes a microcosm. The island represents the individual human and the various characters represent the elements of the human psyche.<br />
In My readings I learned that there were deep physiological symbols which led me to investigate into numerous psychology and sociology books.

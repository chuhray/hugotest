                <p>West meets East&hellip; and Doesn’t Like it.</p>

<p>The novel The Great Gatsby is an interesting tale of two cities really. Nick Carraway; the narrator, represents all that is good an wholesome in the great midwest. He is a well-educated man who aspires to be a bond broker. His character is conflicted internally and externally throughout the novel but really culminates into a loathing for all things eastern. Carraway’s farmboy charm and doe-eyed innocence is put to the test when he meets The Great Jay Gatsby. Gatsby represents all things Nick is unfamiliar with and is curious about. Nick, being from the midwest, has no real street smarts so when he meets the “wicked” east, his lack of experience is proof positive that he really does not belong When Nick meets up with his cousin Daisy and his old classmate Tom in East Egg, he is shown an unfamiliar side of people, a darker side, and he is at a loss and out of his element. Nick is tempted and curious about these things and they lead him away from his midwestern upbringing. The love triangles, the infidelity, gold digging and homicide disgust Nick and he becomes resolved to move back to his midwestern comfort zone almost like in doing so, he will be able to wash himself clean of the experience. Although the character Nick acts as a confidant for those around him, it seems that the burden of their indiscretions is too much for him and he returns to the familiarity and the safety of the morals he was raised on. The real contradiction to Nick is The Great Gatsby himself, Jay. Jay and Nick share a similar small town upbringing but Jay was able to parle his stolen trades into the corrupted version of the American Dream. Most of what Nick knows about Jay is based on his reputation and it’s not until they actually meet and Nick sees the “quality of distortion” in Jay’s New York lifestyle that Nick sees for himself the illusion that Jay created. Nick is attracted to the high life that Gatsby has created in the valley of ashes. Who can blame him with all the lavish parties, cars, mansions, women and other temptations. It’s like Fitzgerald has placed Nick in the Garden of Eden and the two characters; Nick and Jay, represent the good</p>

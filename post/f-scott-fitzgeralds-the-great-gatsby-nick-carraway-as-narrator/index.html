                <p>The narrative point of view adopted by F. Scott Fitzgerald in The Great Gatsby supports the novel&rsquo;s criticism of the upper class and the importance of wealth in society. Fitzgerald uses Nick Carraway as the narrator who views the upper class as entirely superficial. Through his observation of people at Gatsby&rsquo;s party, at the beginning of chapter three, Nick seems to feel that the wealthy are clones of a stereotype accepted and created by themselves. To him it seems as though this society is based on appearance and recognition and judges people according to how much they own rather than what they believe in. Nick&rsquo;s criticisms are accepted by the reader as impartial because Nick is the only major character who is not preoccupied with wealth. He says that his family have been &lsquo;prominent well-to-do people&rsquo; for three generations and that they were hesitant in approving his decision to join the bond business in New York. He talks about having a dog, his old Dodge and a Finnish woman who helps him around the house and ends by saying that he had &lsquo;that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.&rsquo; At this point, by opening up to the reader, a close relationship has been established between the two which is set to last throughout the novel. Nick&rsquo;s opinions and criticisms are accepted by the reader as impartial which greatly influences the reader&rsquo;s interpretation of wealth and the wealthy. Nick is the only major character who is not preoccupied with money or power or belonging to a particular class. This sets him apart from the characters he and the reader are observing and allows him to be used as a measure for other characters. Nick further sets himself apart by being the only person who does not form relationships based on class and money. All around him, people are carefully choosing whom they will be &lsquo;friends&rsquo; with based on how much money they have and if they belong to the right social class. When Nick first goes to Gatsby&rsquo;s party he feels &lsquo;uneasy&rsquo; because he has never met his host however most of the people there were not even invited and they don&rsquo;t feel uneasy at all. By distancing himself from this corrupt upper class Nick comes across as the most honourable person there and</p>

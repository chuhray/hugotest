                <p>Since the beginning of time research and statistics have exercised a vital role in psychology. In this succinct writing an elaboration of how research and statistics are utilized in psychology is revealed. Furthermore, the how and why of such components are expounded herein and a detailed look at primary and secondary data are exposed.<br />
Research, statistics, primary, and secondary data are imperative in psychological analysis. Implementing each of these variants in psychological research may prove beneficial to the researcher when properly appropriated in psychological exploration. In that regard, this discussion begins by portraying the role that research plays in psychology and gives a general synopsis to define each role.

In addition to focusing on the organization and analysis of numbers, statistics is divided into two primary branches. The first branch of statistics is descriptive statistics and the second branch is inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics is relevant in defining or summarizing the role a group of numbers play in research. However, inferential statistics assist the researcher in drawing conclusions and making inferences from numbers based on research, but not limited to that research. Inferential statistics go beyond the premature stage of numerical research and delve into a deeper level of comprehension for the researcher.</p>

<p>Aron, et al (2009) states that, “statistics is a basic process employed by every human that requires observation. Furthermore, statistics help define what something means or what causes it.” Lastly, you perceive or expect a particular outcome based on your research and your intuitive nature.

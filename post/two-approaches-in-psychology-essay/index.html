                <p>Two Approaches In Psychology</p>

<p>In 1900, Sigmund Freud, a neurologist living in Vienna, first published his psychoanalytic theory of personality in which the unconscious mind played a crucial role. Freud combined the then current cognitive notions of consciousness, perception and memory with ideas of biologically based instincts, to make a bold new theory of psychodynamics. Freud&rsquo;s theory, which forms the basis of the psychodynamic approach, represented a challenge and a major alternative to behaviourism.</p>

<p>Freud&rsquo;s theory of personality was based on the assumption that all our behaviour stems from the unconscious processes. He divided the personality into three different parts. The id, the Freud believed infants derived pleasure from withholding and expelling faeces. At the age of three the child derives pleasure from fondling his or her genitals. Freud called this the phallic stage. During the phallic stage the child reaches a conflict called the Oedipal conflict. He describes this in the case of a boy whose sexual impulses are directed towards his mother. This leads him to perceive his father as a rival for affections. The boy fears the father will retaliate by castration. This anxiety is thought to be the basis of all later anxieties.</p>

<p>The Oedipal conflict resolves at the latency period, which lasts from the age of seven to twelve. During this time children become less concerned with their bodies and turn their attention to life skills. Finally, adolescence and puberty bring about the genital stage, the mature phase of adult sexuality.</p>

<p>Freud&rsquo;s theory of child development seems to put to much importance on body-parts and the sexual nature of child development. In particular he seems to have put to much importance on the Oedipus conflict. Freud conducted a case study in a five-year-old boy named Hans. Hans had a phobia of being bitten by a horse. Freud used his theory of the Oedipus conflict to interpret his phobia as an unconscious fear of being castrated by his father. It is worth mentioning that Hans father was a follower and supporter of Freud&rsquo;s ideas.</p>

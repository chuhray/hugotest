                <p>Nick Carraway, The Perfect Narrator Nick Carraway is a prime example of how an unbiased and trustworthy narrator can change a book. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is told in first person point of view, through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a 30-year-old man living in West Egg, New York. Carraway tells the story as it is happening and lets the reader know what is to come. Nick seems to be an “invisible character” because he is involved in the story but not in the major conflict. Nick Carraway is the perfect choice of narrator because he is reliable, connected to the main characters, and has an amicable personality. Nick Carraway is the most reliable character for the choice of narrator. At the beginning of the book Nick’s father Jordan says, “He wants to know, if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over” (78). Gatsby uses Nick to reconnect with Daisy, because he is a mutual friend between the two. Nick is not only connected to the main characters but also has an amicable personality. Nick Carraway’s personality allows people to open up to him and put their trust in him. As a character Nick is a great listener and because of that people tend to share their secrets with him. Daisy said, “I’ll tell you a family secret, she whispered enthusiastically” (13). At this point in the story, Nick is just getting to know Daisy and she is already willing to share secrets with him. Daisy shares most of her secrets about either Tom or Gatsby with Nick, because she trusts him.<br />
It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about-things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool-that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool. (16-17)<br />
Daisy is telling Nick that she made the wrong choice in marrying Tom and that she is a fool for not waiting for Gatsby. Nick is one of the only people that knows this about Daisy and never shares it with anyone else. Nick Carraway is a terrific</p>
